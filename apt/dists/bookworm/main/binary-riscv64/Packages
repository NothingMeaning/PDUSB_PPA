Description: Python Web Services Discovery Daemon, Windows Net Browsing
 This daemon is used to announce Linux Hosts to Windows 7+ computers for
 use in their File Manager network browsing, by using the Windows
 Services Discovery Protocol.
 .
 This protocol is a local network segment procotol, which is multicasted
 on udp/3072, and incoming on tcp/5357 on the 239.255.255.250/ff02::c
 multicast addresses.  It DOES have security issues, but it is designed
 for use in a trusted environment inside a firewall.
 .
 Its quite useful for Samba, taking over from WINS and the Samba nmbd
 daemon.  Installing this restores the Network browsing functionality to
 Windows 7+ Samba clients.
